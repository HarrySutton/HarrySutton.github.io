                <p>
                    For Intertek's rebranded corporate site, I built a visual page builder tool with vanilla JavaScript.
                    This was shared with the non-techy clients so they could create webpages themselves and export them as HTML, 
                    which we could then add to the site. Although this tool is not public, the website created using it is:

                <p>
                    Lincolnshire Energy from Waste plant wanted a system where children who visit the plant on school trips
                    could enter a pledge to be better for the environment on a tablet, which would be displayed on their website.
                    I developed this as a WordPress plugin, which ivolved creating the input screen for the tablet, the public 
                    pledges display page and the CMS backend for managing/editing the pledges, as well as instuctions for the 
                    plant managers to use the system. I also developed the theme of this site, which is used on all FCC EfW sites.

                    I mostly worked on the frontend of this project, using JQuery and AJAX to handle interaction and interface with the backend.

                    While this project was mostly a reskin of the South Hams site, it involved integrating with a different payment
                    system, Pay360, which required use of a SOAP API.

                <p>
                    Every year, Milestone creates a Christmas themed cocktail which they give to their clients and employees. For the last 2 years
                    I made the website to showcase the cocktail and present the instructions. These sites are simple, but were fun to make as they
                    involve more creative design than complex logic. Here you can see 2023's site, but it contains a link to 2022's.
